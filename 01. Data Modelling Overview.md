**View Type**

```
@VDM.viewType:
#BASIC         Basic View
#COMPOSITE     Helper Composite View or ? --- SEGW API View
#TRANSACTIONAL Business Object View for Transactional Processing
#CONSUMPTION   Projection View or Analytical Query or ? --- API View
#EXTENSION:    (Used by SAP)
```

**Data Category - Analytical Only**<br />

```
@Anlaytical.dataCategory:{
  #DIMENSION
  #FACT 
  #CUBE  
  #AGGREGATIONLEVEL: ?
}
```

**Data Models Lifecycle Contract**

? -- Is it API only

```
@VDM.lifecycle.contract.type:
#SAP_INTERNAL_API:   (Used by SAP) for Transactional View
#PUBLIC_LOCAL_API:   (Used by SAP) for Views published for local use in Custom Development 
#PUBLIC_REMOTE_API:  ? --- For API Composite View 
```

# Performance Annotations for Data Models

To estimate resource requirement for data fetching. <br />

**Service Quality**<br />

Quality of service with respect to the expected performance of the CDS view.<br />
'A' has the highest requirements and 'D' the lowest. 

```
@ObjectModel.usageType.serviceQuality:
#A (<=3 Tables)   | High Volume - Business Logic and Background        | Basic Views for ABAP Consumption
#B (<=5 Tables)   | High Volume - Business Logic and Background        | Composite Views for ABAP Consumption
#C (<=15 Tables)  | UI Consumption for Transactional or List Reporting | Consumption or Projection View 
#D (=<100 Tables) | Analytical Reporting                               | Consumption View for Analytical Engine
#D Code Push Down to HANA DB
#P Reserved for views building hierarchy and consumed by Hierarchal View
```

**Data Class**<br />

To support the decision on cache strategies for higher layers.

```
@ObjectModel.usageType.dataClass:
#CUSTOMIZING    Universal Configuration Data | Delivered by SAP & Extended by Customer | Countries, Language etc.
#ORGANIZATIONAL Business Configuration Data  | Created and maintained by Customer      | Company Code, Business Partner etc.
#MASTER         Business Generated Data      | Rarely Changed                          | Purchase Order

#MIXED          If the CDS view contains data of multiple data classes                 | Analytical Reporting
#META           How the system is configured or technical structure of entities. Used by for shipped content
```

**Size Category**<br />

Expected data volume to compute the result set.

```
@ObjectModel.usageType.sizeCategory: 
#S   (<1000)           | #CUSTOMIZING
#M   (<1,00,000)       | #ORGANIZATIONAL 
#L   (<1,00,00,000)    | #MASTER
#XL  (<1,00,00,00,000) | #TRANSACTIONAL
#XXL (>1,00,00,00,000) | Analytical Reporting
```

Ignore the metadata from Composite View <br />

```
@MetadataignorePropagatedAnnotations: true | false
