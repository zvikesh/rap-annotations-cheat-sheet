# Data Modelling Annotations

**View Type**<br />

VDM annotations are _not_ released on cloud, not sure if these annotations are obselete or will be released later.

```
@VDM.viewType:
#BASIC                                Basic View
#COMPOSITE                            Helper Composite View or Fact View or Cube View
#TRANSACTIONAL                        Business Object for Transactional Processing
#CONSUMPTION                          Projection View or Analytical Query or API View
#EXTENSION:                           (Used by SAP)
```

**Usage Type**

```
@VDM.usage.type:{
  #ACTION_PARAMETER_STRUCTURE        Abstract Entity: Input structure of an action function
  #ACTION_RESULT_STRUCTURE           Abstract Entity: Output structure of an action function
  #EVENT_SIGNATURE                   Abstract Entity: Structure for Business Event 
  #TRANSACTIONAL_PROCESSING_SERVICE  Projection View or API View for Transactional Processing
}
```

**SAP only**

```
@VDM.private:true      

@VDM.lifecycle.contract.type:{
  #SAP_INTERNAL_API:                  For SAP internal usage only
  #PUBLIC_LOCAL_API:                  Ready to consume but locally within the System 
  #PUBLIC_REMOTE_API:                 Ready to consume as remote API 
}

@VDM.lifecycle:{
  status: #DEPERECATED                CDS shall no longer be used. Instead the given successor shall be used
  successor: #ENTITY                  Successor entity name
}
```

**Data Category - Analytical Only**<br />

```
@Analytical.dataCategory:{
  #DIMENSION         Master Data ex: Material Master View, Customer Master View et.c
  #FACT              Center of Star Schema. Measurable or Item Data. 
  #CUBE              FACT + DIMENSION
  #AGGREGATIONLEVEL: ? --- Projection View with write-back (planning) functionality 
}
```

Queries are built on the the of #CUBE view and annotated as:

```
@Analytical.query: true
```

# Performance Annotations for Data Models

To estimate resource requirement for data fetching. <br />

**Service Quality**<br />

Quality of service with respect to the expected performance of the CDS view.<br />
'A' has the highest requirements and 'D' the lowest. 

```
@ObjectModel.usageType.serviceQuality:
#A (<=3 Tables)   | High Volume - Business Logic and Background        | Basic Views for ABAP Consumption
#B (<=5 Tables)   | High Volume - Business Logic and Background        | Composite Views for ABAP Consumption
#C (<=15 Tables)  | UI Consumption for Transactional or List Reporting | Consumption or Projection View 
#D (=<100 Tables) | Analytical Reporting                               | Consumption View for Analytical Engine
#D Code Push Down to HANA DB
#P Reserved for views building hierarchy and consumed by Hierarchal View
```

**Data Class**<br />

To support the decision on cache strategies for higher layers.

```
@ObjectModel.usageType.dataClass:
#CUSTOMIZING    Universal Configuration Data | Delivered by SAP & Extended by Customer | Countries, Language etc.
#ORGANIZATIONAL Business Configuration Data  | Created and maintained by Customer      | Company Code, Business Partner etc.
#MASTER         Business Generated Data      | Rarely Changed                          | Purchase Order
#TRANSACTIONAL  Business Generated Data      | Frequently Changed                      | Purchase Order Item
#MIXED          If the CDS view contains data of multiple data classes                 | Analytical Reporting
#META           How the system is configured or technical structure of entities. Used by for shipped content
```

**Size Category**<br />

Expected data volume to compute the result set.

```
@ObjectModel.usageType.sizeCategory: 
#S   (<1000)           | #CUSTOMIZING
#M   (<1,00,000)       | #ORGANIZATIONAL 
#L   (<1,00,00,000)    | #MASTER
#XL  (<1,00,00,00,000) | #TRANSACTIONAL
#XXL (>1,00,00,00,000) | Analytical Reporting
```

# Other Annotations

**Ignore Metadata Propogation**<br />

Ignore the metadata from Composite View <br />

```
@MetadataignorePropagatedAnnotations: true | false
```

**Object Model Annotations for Text Table**<br />

```
@ObjectModel.dataCategory: #TEXT
```

# Only Standard View Annotations

**Allow Metadata Extension**<br />

To allow Metadata Extensions.<br />

```
@Metadata.allowExtensions: true | false             
```

**Enhancement Category**<br />

```
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: [#NONE | #GROUP_BY | #UNION | #PROJECTION_LIST]
```
